      <p class="lead text mb-4">
        Łuna is an all-in-one Home Access Center viewer built to make grades simple, smart, and stress-free.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        What started as a small idea, originally called <strong>Zephyr</strong>, turned into a full project developed solo from August to November 2025. Łuna was born out of necessity after <strong>GradeWay</strong> stopped working due to Texas's school phone restrictions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        I wanted something lightweight yet powerful. A place where everything related to school performance lives in one clean dashboard. 
        Not just a viewer, but an area where students can <strong>see grades clearly, predict outcomes, analyze trends, and actually understand progress</strong> without digging through slow or outdated systems.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted mb-0">
        Łuna is designed with one goal in mind: to make checking grades feel less like a chore and more like a quick insight into how you're doing; 
        whether that's keeping track of your classes, experimenting with "what-if" predictions, or simply staying motivated throughout the semester.
